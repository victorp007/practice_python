a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# Print all the elements of the list that are less than 5
for i in a:
    if i < 5:
        print(i)

# Extras 1
# Initialize an empty list
lst = []
# We loop through the contents of list a
for i in a:
# We then append integers that are smaller than 5 to the newly initialized list and then print it
    if i < 5:
        lst.append(i)
print(lst)

# Extras 2
# Using a lambda function to create a new list that holds items from a that are less than 5
print(list(filter(lambda x: x < 5, a)))

# Extras 3
# Using the same technique but this time the new list will hold items that are smaller than the variable called num 
num = int(input("Number you've chosen?: "))

print(list(filter(lambda x: x < num, a)))
